**FC++** (Functional C++) is a programming paradigm in **C++** that integrates **functional programming** (FP) techniques with object-oriented features and the flexibility of C++.

### **Key Concepts of Functional Programming in C++ (FC++)**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In C++, FC++ involves using functional programming concepts such as:
- **Immutability**
- **First-class functions**
- **Higher-order functions**
- **Lambdas**
- **Pure functions**
- **Composing functions**

C++ is traditionally an imperative and object-oriented language, but you can still apply FP principles to make your code cleaner, more maintainable, and potentially more efficient.

Let's explore the main components and ideas of **FC++**:

### 1. **First-Class Functions**
In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

In C++, this is accomplished with **function pointers**, **lambdas**, and **std::function** (part of the C++ Standard Library).

#### **Example: Functions as First-Class Citizens**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// Function that accepts another function as an argument
void applyFunction(std::function<int(int)> func, int x) {
    std::cout << "Result: " << func(x) << std::endl;
}

// A simple function to be passed
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    // Pass function as argument
    applyFunction(square, 5);  // Output: Result: 25

    // Using a lambda expression
    applyFunction([](int x) { return x + 10; }, 5);  // Output: Result: 15

    return 0;
}
```

Here, `std::function` allows us to pass both regular functions and lambdas as arguments to `applyFunction`.

### 2. **Lambdas**
C++11 introduced **lambdas**, which are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding scope. Lambdas are a core part of functional programming in C++.

#### **Example: Lambda Functions**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Lambda that adds two numbers
    auto add = [](int x, int y) { return x + y; };
    
    std::cout << "Sum: " << add(3, 4) << std::endl;  // Output: Sum: 7

    return 0;
}
```

You can also capture variables from the surrounding scope:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;

    // Capture 'a' by reference and 'b' by value
    auto add = [&a, b]() { return a + b; };

    std::cout << "Sum: " << add() << std::endl;  // Output: Sum: 30
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. **Pure Functions**
A **pure function** is a function where the output is determined solely by its input, with no side effects (such as modifying global variables or printing to the screen). In functional programming, pure functions are encouraged because they make the code easier to reason about and test.

#### **Example: Pure Function**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Pure function - no side effects
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(2, 3);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;  // Output: Result: 5
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. **Immutability**
Functional programming encourages **immutable** data, meaning that once a value is set, it cannot be changed. In C++, this can be achieved using the `const` keyword.

#### **Example: Immutable Data**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const int a = 10;  // Immutable variable
    // a = 20;  // Error: Cannot modify a const variable
    std::cout << "Value of a: " << a << std::endl;  // Output: Value of a: 10
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Higher-Order Functions**
A **higher-order function** is a function that either:
- Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- Returns a function as its result.

In C++, higher-order functions are typically implemented with **function pointers**, **std::function**, or **lambdas**.

#### **Example: Higher-Order Function**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// Higher-order function that takes a function as an argument
int applyTwice(std::function<int(int)> func, int x) {
    return func(func(x));
}

int addFive(int x) {
    return x + 5;
}

int main() {
    // Apply 'addFive' twice
    std::cout << "Result: " << applyTwice(addFive, 10) << std::endl;  // Output: Result: 20

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `applyTwice` takes a function (`addFive`) and applies it twice to the input.

### 6. **Composing Functions**
In functional programming, **function composition** refers to combining two or more functions to create a new function. This allows for complex behaviors to be built from simpler ones.

#### **Example: Function Composition**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// Function composition: Combine two functions
std::function<int(int)> compose(std::function<int(int)> f, std::function<int(int)> g) {
    return [f, g](int x) { return f(g(x)); };
}

int multiplyByTwo(int x) {
    return x * 2;
}

int addThree(int x) {
    return x + 3;
}

int main() {
    // Compose two functions
    auto composedFunc = compose(multiplyByTwo, addThree);
    
    // Apply the composed function
    std::cout << "Result: " << composedFunc(5) << std::endl;  // Output: Result: 16
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `compose` function combines `multiplyByTwo` and `addThree` to create a new function, which is then applied to `5`. The output is `((5 + 3) * 2) = 16`.

### 7. **Lazy Evaluation**
In functional programming, **lazy evaluation** delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. While C++ does not have built-in lazy evaluation like Haskell, you can implement lazy evaluation with **lambdas** and **`std::function`**.

#### **Example: Lazy Evaluation Using Lambdas**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

// Lazy evaluation using lambda
int main() {
    auto lazyEval = []() -> int {
        std::cout << "Evaluating..." << std::endl;
        return 42;
    };

    std::cout << "Before evaluation" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Lazy result: " << lazyEval() << std::endl;  // Evaluation happens here
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the lambda expression `lazyEval` is not evaluated until it's actually called.

### Conclusion

FC++ combines **functional programming** concepts with the **C++** language, allowing you to write cleaner, more modular, and reusable code. C++ does not support pure functional programming out of the box, but through features like **lambdas**, **function pointers**, **higher-order functions**, and **immutable data**, you can bring many functional programming principles into your C++ codebase.

To summarize, **FC++** involves:
- Using **first-class functions**, **higher-order functions**, and **pure functions**.
- Embracing **immutability** and **laziness**.
- Taking advantage of **function composition** and **lambdas**.
  
This approach can lead to cleaner, more flexible code that is easier to reason about, and can lead to better performance when combined with C++'s low-level capabilities.
